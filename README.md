# sru-lint

Static analysis tool for Ubuntu SRU (Stable Release Update) patches — built to run in CI and generate human-friendly reports.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install from snap (recommended)
snap install --edge sru-lint

# Or install with Poetry (for development)
git clone https://github.com/dargad/sru-lint.git
cd sru-lint
poetry install

# Check from a patches-unapplied git repo (the current directory)
sru-lint check .

# Check a patch file or URL
sru-lint check path/to/patch.debdiff  # if installed via snap
poetry run sru-lint check path/to/patch.debdiff  # if using Poetry
sru-lint check https://example.com/patch.diff

# Check from stdin
cat patch.debdiff | sru-lint check -  # if installed via snap
cat patch.debdiff | poetry run sru-lint check -  # if using Poetry

# List available plugins
sru-lint plugins  # if installed via snap
poetry run sru-lint plugins  # if using Poetry
```

## Authenticating to Launchpad

By default `sru-lint` talks to Launchpad anonymously, which is enough for the
public checks. ESM / Ubuntu Pro plugins query private PPAs (e.g.
`ppa:ubuntu-esm/esm-infra-security`) and need an authenticated session —
without it those checks are skipped or produce false negatives.

To authenticate once and cache the OAuth credentials in your keyring:

```bash
sru-lint login                # opens a browser to authorize via OAuth
poetry run sru-lint login     # equivalent when running from source
```

Subsequent `sru-lint check` runs reuse the cached credentials automatically.
Re-run `sru-lint login` only if the credentials expire or are revoked.

Note: if no usable keyring backend is available (headless session, snap
confinement blocking the keyring, etc.) the credentials cannot persist and
`sru-lint check` will fall back to anonymous access — `sru-lint login` will
warn you when this happens.

## What it checks

- **Changelog entries** (valid distributions, LP bugs, version ordering)
- **DEP-3 patch format** compliance
- **Launchpad integration** (bug targeting, SRU templates, publication history)
- **Upload queue** conflicts
- And more via the plugin system...

## Development

Run the full local check suite (ruff lint + format, mypy, unit tests, and
functional tests) with a single command:

```bash
poetry run check-all
```

It runs every step even if an earlier one fails and prints a PASS/FAIL summary
at the end, exiting non-zero if anything failed.
